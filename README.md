# Animate.js
*Just-add-water Web Animations*

**PSA: This is the `gh-pages` branch, home of the Animate.js website. To download the latest version of Animate.js, switch to the `master` branch.**

## Contributing to the Animate.js website
The Animate.js website is a simple little one-pager. When you add an animation to the master branch in a pull request, you should open a second pull request adding the animation to the website.
